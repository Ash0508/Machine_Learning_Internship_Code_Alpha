# Machine Learning Internship at Code Alpha

## Task 1: Credit Scoring Model
Develop a credit scoring model using classification algorithms to predict individuals' creditworthiness based on historical financial data. Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance.

## Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech
Build a deep learning model for emotion recognition in speech audio. Utilize speech processing techniques to classify spoken sentences into emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness.

## Task 3: Handwritten Character Recognition
Create a system for handwritten character recognition capable of identifying various characters or alphabets. Extend the system to recognize entire words or sentences for enhanced functionality.

## Task 4: Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Develop a disease prediction model using classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of diseases based on medical data such as symptoms and patient history. Utilize labeled medical records datasets for training and evaluation.

Each task presents an exciting opportunity to apply machine learning techniques and contribute to innovative projects. Let's collaborate, innovate, and make a difference in the world of machine learning at Code Alpha!
